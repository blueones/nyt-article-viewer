# NYT Article Viewer

This app will allow a user to search for historical and current news articles from the New York Times API. 

When the app loads, the user will see a form with a start date, end date, and search text field with a submit button. The user must enter a start date, end date, and search text in the form in order for any news articles to appear in a list under the form when the submit button is clicked.

An image will show under the form when the app loads but will be replaced with a list of news articles when news articles are found based on the search criteria. 

When articles are found, each news article will contain an image, a snippet of the article, and the author if available. If there is no image, a placeholder image will display. The user can click on the image that is displayed and it will open a new tab in the browser so the user can read the full article.

After the news articles display, a drop down will display for sorting the articles in the list. The default sort order is set to sort by publication date of the articles in ascending order. The user can select to sort the news articles list by word count as well, which will sort the list in ascending order by word count. 

If no articles are found, the image that is seen when the app loads will display.
